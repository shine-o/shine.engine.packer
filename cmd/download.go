	downloadCmd.PersistentFlags().String("patch-hive", "http://patch.cdn.gamigo.com/fo/de/PatchHive.txt", "list of .gdp files, e.g: PatchHive.txt, http://patch.cdn.gamigo.com/fous/gdp/PatchHive.txt")
	downloadCmd.PersistentFlags().String("destination-path", "gdp-downloads", "Path on system where downloaded .gdp files should be persisted")
	downloadCmd.PersistentFlags().Bool("overwrite", false, "Download and replace if the file already exists")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// downloadCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
